# 🌍 Global Layoffs Data Cleaning Project (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, standardizing, and preparing a real-world dataset of global company layoffs for analysis.  
The goal is to transform messy raw data into a reliable, structured dataset using **SQL**.

This kind of data preparation is what analysts actually do before running reports or building dashboards.

It includes:
- Company name  
- Industry  
- Country  
- Total layoffs  
- Percentage laid off
